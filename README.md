# VanillaRNN-TextGenerator

## Overview
VanillaRNN-TextGenerator is a character-level text generation project using a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The goal is to train the model to generate text character by character, exploring various configurations and understanding the limitations of simple RNNs.

## Features
- Custom Vanilla RNN implementation using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Configurable hidden layer sizes and sequence lengths.
- Temperature-controlled sampling for text generation.

## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure
- `rnn.py`: Contains the implementation of the Vanilla RNN model.
- `utils.py`: Includes utility functions for text vectorization and generation.
- `Procedure.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for experimentation, model and implementation development.
- `Closure.md`: Project closure review and evaluation.
- `Product_Requirements_Document.md`: Detailed requirements and scope of the project.
