## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a character-level text generation model using a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The goal is to train the model to generate text character by character, exploring various configurations and understanding the limitations of simple RNNs.

## Scope
### Included
- Implementation of a Vanilla RNN from scratch using NumPy or a deep learning framework (PyTorch/TensorFlow).
- Training on a selected text corpus (e.g., Shakespeare, Wikipedia snippets).
- Experimentation with different hyperparameters.

### Excluded
- Advanced RNN architectures (e.g., LSTM, GRU).
- Deployment of the model in a production environment.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **REQ-001**: The system shall allow users to input a text corpus for training.
- **REQ-002**: The system shall implement a Vanilla RNN architecture.
- **REQ-003**: The system shall support training with configurable hidden layer sizes.
- **REQ-004**: The system shall allow users to specify sequence lengths for training.
- **REQ-005**: The system shall implement temperature sampling for text generation.
- **REQ-006**: The system shall output generated text based on the trained model.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The system shall be able to train on a dataset of up to 1 million characters.
- **NFR-002**: The training process shall complete within 2 hours on a standard GPU.
- **NFR-003**: The generated text shall be coherent to a reasonable degree, with a minimum of 70% readability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The model successfully trains on the provided text corpus without errors.
- The generated text shows improvement in coherence after training compared to untrained outputs.
- The system allows for experimentation with different hyperparameters, and results are documented.
